# Why is the "American Dream" Fading? 

- Why are children's chances of climbing the income ladder falling in the USA?
  
  - What can be done to reverse this trend?

- Need to go beyond macroeconomic data to ansawer this question. Why?
  
  - Too many changes happening over time and across space to separate out the causal factors.

  - Also: only a handful of data points (classic macro problem)

---
# Enter the Opportunity Atlas 

- Created in 2018, the Opportunity Atlas offers one measure of how income mobility differs by location in the USA
  
  - If some areas have more mobility than others, can we learn why and apply those lessons elsewhere?

- Data sources: 
  - Anonymized Census data (2000, 2010 ACS) covering U.S. population
  - Federal income tax returns from 1989-2015.

- Method: Link parents based on dependent claiming on tax returns 

- Target sample: Children born between 1978-1983 (U.S. citizens and authorized immigrants who arrived as children)

There's bound to be a messy with this much data, so they create an analysis sample

- **Analysis sample**: 20.5 million children, 96% coverge of target sample

---
# Toolkit to use these data

- Data cleaning and wrangling

- Data visualization

- Spatial analysis

- Regression analysis (next class)

---
# Parent and Children Incomes in Tax Data

- Parent household incomes: average income reported on Form 1040 tax return from 1994-2000

- Children incomes measured from tax returns in 2014-15 (ages 31-37)

- But income levels differ over time! How do we compare them?

  - Use percentile ranks in the *national* distribution
  - Rank children relative to others born in same year and parents relative to other parents

- **Income percentile**: The fraction of the national income distribution that a person's income exceeds

- Take average income percentile of children by parental income percentile

---

# What is mobility for each Census tract? 

- Run this same regression of income ranks by Census tract in the USA 
  - Census tracts are small geographic areas that contain 1,200-8,000 people
  
- Technical detail: Weight each child by fraction of childhood (up to 23) in a given area
  - Accounts for movement across areas during childhood

# Why does upward mobility differ across areas? 

- Why do some areas have more upward mobility than others?

- Spatial and correlational analysis is a good place to start

- What are potential characteristics of high mobility areas?

  - Better jobs?
  - Better schools? 
  - Institutional differences?
  - Culture?

# Actual correlates

1. Segregation: Greater racial and income segregation associated with lower levels of mobility

2. Income Inequality: Places with smaller middle class have less mobility

3. School Quality: Higher expenditure, smaller classes, higher test scores correlated with more mobility

4. Family Structure: 
  - Areas with more single parents have lower mobility
  - Strong correlation even for kids whose *own* parents are married

5. Social Capital
  - It takes a village to raise a child
  - Chetty et al. (2023) leveraged Facebook Data to create the Social Capital Atlas

We'll look at some of these relationships (and their applications) in more detail in the coming weeks.

# Big question: why don't people move? 

- If some areas have more mobility than others, why don't people move to those areas?

- Is it rent?

# Big question: why don't people move? 

- Initial experiments indicate benefits exist from moving (we'll see later)

- If some areas have more mobility than others, why don't people move to those areas?

- Is it rent? 

- Other costs of moving? 

- Maybe they do not want to move as far? 

- Overall, this is not a highly effective approach

---
# Well what if we invest locally? 

- What if we invest in the areas that have low mobility? (place-based approach)

- Would there be spillovers between locations? 
  - It is tough to improve one neighborhood (e.g. a tract), let alone many at once
  - Do we have to improve them all at once to help people? 

- The answer to this question changes the policy approach

# Overall Takeaways

- Correlation evidence is suggestive, but not causal

- Causality requires a more focused approach 

- We will build this toolkit in the next few lectures
