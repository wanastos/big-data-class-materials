# Why this course?

Fill in the gaps left by traditional econometrics and methods classes.

- Practical skills that tools that will benefit your thesis and future career.
- Neglected skills like how to actually find datasets in the wild and clean them.
- Apply skills to answer and address empirical questions on economic and *social* problems. 

Data science skills are largely distinct from (and complementary to) the core 'metrics familiar to economists.

- Acquiring data; scraping; maintaining databases; etc. 
- Data viz, cleaning and wrangling; programming; cloud computation; relational databases; machine learning; etc.

--

> *"In short, we will cover things that I wish someone had taught me when I was starting out in college."*

# Caveat

- This course will be **hard.** You will need to:
  - Teach yourself new skills I cannot cover in 12 weeks
  - Be entrepreneurial: If you find a better way to do something, do (and share) it!
  - Be patient: You will encounter bugs and errors, and you will need to learn how to fix them

- This course will also be **rewarding**
  - You can avoid the mistakes you make here on your thesis and in your career
  - You will learn skills that employers, pre-doc programs, and graduate schools want (but teach poorly)
  - You will learn how to be a better researcher and a better citizen
    - Seriously, a little data science goes a long way in helping you see through BS

# What is Data Science?

- .hi[Data science (DS):] The scientific discipline that deals with transforming data into useful information ("insights") using a variety of stats/ML techniques

    - Amazon: Collects data on search history, cart history, purchases

    - Analyzes the data to estimate users' willingness to pay for various products (including Prime); recommend new products

- The rise of data science has come because of the so-called Big Data revolution

    - The rise of the internet in the late-1990s and 2000s $\Rightarrow \,\uparrow$ opportunities for companies and governments to collect data on consumers & citizens

    - Proliferation of mobile devices & social media from late 2000s until now has generated even more data

# What is Big Data?

It depends on who you ask. It could mean:

1. "Wild" data (unstructured; happenstance; collected without a particular intention; e.g. twitter, contrast with Census surveys)

2. "Wide" data (a.k.a. "Big-K" data because $K>N$, customer data sets where each click is a variable)

3. "Long" data (a.k.a. "Big-N" data because $N$ very, very large [and may not all fit onto a single hard drive!], government tax records, Medicare claims data, etc.)

4. Any data set that cannot be analyzed with classical methods like OLS (e.g. all combinations of the above three types)

"Big Data" not so much about size of data, but about whether or not "small data" (read: classical) methods can be used

    - Google: AlphaGo, computer that defeated world champion Go player

    - Apple/Amazon/Microsoft: Siri, Alexa, Cortana, Talon voice assistants

- ML is a subset of AI

---
# Big data & machine learning

- You'll often hear the phrase "big data and machine learning"

- This is because many machine learning algorithms are helpful for big data problems:

    - Selecting which $k<K$ covariates should enter your model

    - Streamlined techniques for processing "wild" data

    - New modeling approaches that can leverage the greater amount of information that Big Data has

# ChatGPT and GitHub CoPilot

- I strongly encourage you to use ChatGPT and GitHub CoPilot in all aspects of this class

- ChatGPT is a large language model (LLM) developed by OpenAI

- Create an account at http://chat.openai.com/

- ChatGPT is excellent at producing basic code and helping resolve bugs

- It takes most of the headache away from coding, leaving only the "fun" parts

# ChatGPT example

**Human:**

Write a SQL script that does the following:

(a) Read in the Florida insurance data CSV file

(b) Print out the first 10 rows of the data set

(c) List which counties are in the sample (i.e. list unique values of the county variable)

(d) Compute the average property appreciation from 2011 to 2012 (i.e. compute the
mean of tiv_2012 - tiv_2011)

(e) Create a frequency table of the construction variable to see what fraction of
buildings are made out of wood or some other material

---
# ChatGPT example (continued)

**Assistant:**

Assuming the Florida insurance data is stored in a table called "insurance" and the columns are named "county", "tiv_2011", "tiv_2012", and "construction", the SQL script would be as follows:

.scroll-box-8[
```sql
-- (a) Read in the Florida insurance data CSV file
CREATE TABLE insurance (county VARCHAR(255), tiv_2011 INT, tiv_2012 INT, construction VARCHAR(255));
LOAD DATA INFILE 'florida_insurance.csv' INTO TABLE insurance
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;

-- (b) Print out the first 10 rows of the data set
SELECT * FROM insurance LIMIT 10;

-- (c) List which counties are in the sample (i.e. list unique values of the county variable)
SELECT DISTINCT county FROM insurance;

-- (d) Compute the average property appreciation from 2011 to 2012 (i.e. compute the mean of tiv_2012 - tiv_2011)
SELECT AVG(tiv_2012 - tiv_2011) FROM insurance;

-- (e) Create a frequency table of the construction variable to see what fraction of buildings are made out of wood or some other material
SELECT construction, COUNT(*) as frequency FROM insurance GROUP BY construction;

```
]

Note: This is basic SQL script and it may vary based on the database you are using. You may need to make some modification accordingly.

# AI assistance and accessibility

- I actively used GitHub CoPilot to write these Rmarkdown slides
- I used a voice-to-text tool (Talon) to dictate text and comments while in a sling
- Asked CoPilot to write code for me based on the comments

# Correlation vs. causation

- Machine learning is not the end-all, be-all of data science

- A good data scientist knows that correlation is not causation!

- ML is good at prediction, but not necessarily at causal inference

- More on this later! First, let's get into software

# Why R and RStudio? (cont.)

### Data science positivism

- Alongside Python, R has become the *de facto* language for data science.
  - See: [*The Impressive Growth of R*](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/10/impressive-growth-r/), [*The Popularity of Data Science Software*](http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/)
- Open-source (free!) with a global user-base spanning academia and industry.
  - "Do you want to be a profit source or a cost center?"

### Bridge to applied economics and other tools

- Already has all of the statistics and econometrics support, and is amazingly adaptable as a “glue” language to other
programming languages and APIs.
- The RStudio IDE and ecosystem allow for further, seemless integration.

### Path dependency

- It's also the language that I know (second) best.
--

- (Learning multiple languages is a good idea, though.)

# Some R basics

1. Everything is an object.

2. Everything has a name.

3. You do things using functions.

4. Functions come pre-written in packages (i.e. "libraries"), although you can — and should — write your own functions too.

--

</br>

Points 1. and 2. can be summarised as an [object-orientated programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) (OOP) approach.
  - This may sound super abstract now, but we'll see *lots* of examples over the coming weeks that will make things clear.

---
# R vs Stata

If you're coming from Stata, some additional things worth emphasizing:

- Multiple objects (e.g. data frames) can exist happily in the same workspace. 
   - No more `keep`, `preserve`, `restore` hackery. (Though, props to [Stata 16](https://www.stata.com/new-in-stata/multiple-datasets-in-memory/).)
   - This is a direct consequence of the OOP approach.

- You will load packages at the start of every new R session. Make peace with this.
  - "Base" R comes with tons of useful in-built functions. It also provides all the tools necessary for you to write your own functions. 
  - However, many of R's best data science functions and tools come from external packages written by other users.

- R easily and infinitely parallelizes. For free.
  - Compare the cost of a [Stata/MP](https://www.stata.com/statamp/) license, nevermind the fact that you effectively pay per core...

- You don't need to `tsset or xtset` your data. (Although you can too.)

---
# R code example (linear regression)

```{r fit}
fit = lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
summary(fit)
```

---
# Base R plot

```{r mtcars_baseplot, dev="svg"}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, .1)) ## Just for nice plot margins on this slide deck
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg)
abline(fit, col = "red")
```

---
# ggplot2

```{r mtcars_ggplot, dev="svg"}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "red") +

# Do increases in GDP cause life expectancy to increase? 

- Let's use our new-found R knowledge to try to separate correlation from causation for a critical question in economics:
  - Does increasing the economic pie (GDP) lead to longer lives (life expectancy)?

- We can use the gapminder dataset to explore this question
- The gapminder dataset contains panel data on life expectancy, population size, and GDP per capita for 142 countries since the 1950s
- Any predictions about what we'll learn?

# Install and load

Open up your laptops. For the remainder of this first lecture, we're going to pla around with [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) (i.e. livecoding) to answer our question about GDP and life expectancy.

If you don't have them already, install the `ggplot2` and `causaldata` packages via either:
- **Console:** Enter `install.packages(c("ggplot2", "causaldata"), dependencies=T)`.
- **RStudio:** Click the "Packages" tab in the bottom-right window pane. Then click "Install" and search for these two packages.
  
![](pics/install.gif)

---
# Install and load (cont.)

Once the packages are installed, load them into your R session with the `library()` function.
```{r pkg_load}
library(ggplot2)
library(causaldata) ## We're just using this package for the gapminder data, it has many useful datasets! 
```

Notice too that you don't need quotes around the package names any more. Reason: R now recognises these packages as defined objects with given names. ("Everything in R is an object and everything has a name.")

--

PS — A convenient way to combine the package installation and loading steps is with the [pacman package's](https://github.com/trinker/pacman) `p_load()` function. If you run `pacman::p_load(ggplot, causaldata)` it will first look to see whether it needs to install either package before loading them. Clever.
- We'll get to this next week, but if you want to run a function from an (installed) package without loading it, you can use the `PACKAGE::package_function()` syntax.

---
# Brief aside: The gapminder dataset

Because we're going to be plotting the [gapminder](https://github.com/jennybc/gapminder) dataset, it is helpful to know that it contains panel data on life expectancy, population size, and GDP per capita for 142 countries since the 1950s.

```{r gapm}
gapminder
```

When opening a new dataset, it is important to know why. What question are we asking?

Today we want to know: 
- Does increased GDP per capita lead to increased life expectancy? 
- If not, what can we say about the two? 

---
# Elements of ggplot2

[Hadley Wickham's](http://hadley.nz/) ggplot2 is one of the most popular packages in the entire R canon. 
- It also happens to be built upon some deep visualization theory: i.e. Leland Wilkinson's [*The Grammar of Graphics*](https://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448).

There's a lot to say about ggplot2's implementation of this "grammar of graphics" approach, but the three key elements are:

1. Your plot ("the visualization") is linked to your variables ("the data") through various **aesthetic mappings**.

2. Once the aesthetic mappings are defined, you can represent your data in different ways by choosing different **geoms** (i.e. "geometric objects" like points, lines or bars).

3. You build your plot in **layers**.

--

That's kind of abstract. Let's review each element in turn with some actual plots.

---
# 1. Aesthetic mappings

```{r, aesthetics0}
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point()
```
---
# 1. Aesthetic mappings (cont.)

```{r aesthetics1, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Focus on the top line, which contains the initialising `ggplot()` function call. This function accepts various arguments, including:
- Where the data come from (i.e. `data = gapminder`).
- What the aesthetic mappings are (i.e. `mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)`).

--

The aesthetic mappings here are pretty simple: They just define an x-axis (GDP per capita) and a y-axis (life expecancy).
- To get a sense of the power and flexibility that comes with this approach, however, consider what happens if we add more aesthetics to the plot call...

---
# 1. Aesthetic mappings (cont.)

```{r aesthetics2, dev='svg'}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, col = continent)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) ## "alpha" controls transparency. Takes a value between 0 and 1.
```

--

Note that I've dropped the "mapping =" part of the ggplot call. Most people just start with "aes(...)", since `ggplot2` knows the order of the arguments.

---
# 1. Aesthetic mappings (cont.)

We can specify aesthetic mappings in the geom layer too.
```{r aesthetics3, dev='svg'}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + ## Applicable to all geoms
  geom_point(aes(size = pop, col = continent), alpha = 0.3) ## Applicable to this geom only
```

---
# 1. Aesthetic mappings (cont.)

Oops. What went wrong here?
```{r aesthetics_mistake, warning=FALSE,dev='svg'}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point(aes(size = "big", col="black"), alpha = 0.3)
```

--

**Answer: **Aesthetics must be mapped to variables, not descriptions!

---
# 1. Aesthetic mappings (cont.)

At this point, instead of repeating the same ggplot2 call every time, it will prove convenient to define an intermediate plot object that we can re-use.

```{r p, dev='svg'}
p = ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))
p
```

---
# 2. Geoms

Once your variable relationships have been defined by the aesthetic mappings, you can invoke and combine different geoms to generate different visulaizations.

```{r geoms1, dev='svg'}
p + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3)  +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") 
```

---
# Check back on question

Does increased GDP per capita lead to increased life expectancy?
- There is a positive relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy
- Is it causal? Unclear.
- What other factors might be at play?
- Can we rule those out? 
- What about time? 

---
# 2. Geoms (cont.): account for population and geography

Aesthetics can be applied differentially across geoms.

```{r geoms2, dev='svg'}
p + 
  geom_point(aes(size = pop, col = continent), alpha = 0.3)  +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") 
```

---
# 2. Geoms (cont.)

The previous plot provides a good illustration of the power (or effect) that comes from assigning aesthetic mappings "globally" vs in the individual geom layers.
- Compare: What happens if you run the below code chunk?

```{r geoms3, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, col = continent)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3)  +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") 
```

---
# 2. Geoms (cont.)

Similarly, note that some geoms only accept a subset of mappings. E.g. `geom_density()` doesn't know what to do with the "y" aesthetic mapping.

```{r geoms4, error=TRUE, dev='svg'}
p + geom_density()
```

---
# 2. Geoms (cont.)

We can fix that by being more careful about how we build the plot.

```{r geoms5, dev='svg'}
ggplot(data = gapminder) + ## i.e. No "global" aesthetic mappings"
  geom_density(aes(x = gdpPercap, fill = continent), alpha=0.3)
```

---
# 3. Build your plot in layers

We've already seen how we can chain (or "layer") consecutive plot elements using the `+` connector.
- The fact that we can create and then re-use an intermediate plot object (e.g. "p") is testament to this.

But it bears repeating: You can build out some truly impressive complexity and transformation of your visualization through this simple layering process.
- You don't have to transform your original data; ggplot2 takes care of all of that.
- For example (see next slide for figure).

- **Bonus:** Maybe this will help make sense of the non-linear relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy?

```{r layers1}
p2 =
  p +
  geom_point(aes(size = pop, col = continent), alpha = 0.3) +
  scale_color_brewer(name = "Continent", palette = "Set1") + ## Different colour scale
  scale_size(name = "Population", labels = scales::comma) + ## Different point (i.e. legend) scale
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar) + ## Switch to logarithmic scale on x-axis. Use dollar units.
  labs(x = "Log (GDP per capita)", y = "Life Expectancy") + ## Better axis titles
  theme_minimal() ## Try a minimal (b&w) plot theme
```

---
# 3. Build your plot in layers (cont.)

```{r layers2,  echo=FALSE, dev='svg'}
p2
```

---
# What else?

We have barely scratched the surface of ggplot2's functionality... let alone talked about the entire ecosystem of packages that has been built around it. 
- Here's are two quick additional examples to whet your appetite

--

Note that you will need to install and load some additional packages if you want to recreate the next two figures on your own machine. A quick way to do this:

```{r pacinstall}
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(hrbrthemes, gganimate)
```

---
# What else? (cont.)

Simple extension: Use an external package theme.
```{r modern_rc_theme,  dev='svg'}
# library(hrbrthemes)
p2 + theme_modern_rc() + geom_point(aes(size = pop, col = continent), alpha = 0.2)
```

---
# Check back on question

Does increased GDP per capita lead to increased life expectancy?
- There is a positive relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy
- Is it causal? Unclear.
- What other factors might be at play?
- Can we rule those out? 
- What about time? 

---
# What else? (cont.)

Elaborate extension: Animation! (See the next slide for the resulting GIF.)
```{r gganim1, eval=FALSE}
# library(gganimate)
ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop, colour = country)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar) +
  facet_wrap(~continent) +
  # Here comes the gganimate specific bits
  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', x = 'Log (GDP per capita)', y = 'Life expectancy') +
  transition_time(year) +
  ease_aes('linear')
```

---
# What else? (cont.)

```{r gganim2, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop, colour = country)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar) +
  facet_wrap(~continent) + 
  # Here comes the gganimate specific bits
  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', x = 'Log (GDP per capita)', y = 'Life expectancy') +
  transition_time(year) +
  ease_aes('linear')
```

Note that this animated plot provides a much more intuitive understanding of the underlying data. Just as [Hans Rosling](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen) intended.

---
# Correlation vs. causation

- A good ML model will account for continent, time, GDP per capita, and many other factors to predict life expectancy

- How do you answer each of these to a policymaker? 
  - What is the _predicted effect_ of increasing GDP by \$1000 on life expectancy? 
  - What is the _counterfacual effect_ of increasing GDP by \$1000 on life expectancy? 

- Economists' comparative advantage is in combining machine learning with economic theory to answer these questions

---
# But do increases in GDP per capita cause life expectancy to increase?

- We can't answer this question with a simple plot.
- We also can't answer this question with a very fancy plot. 
- What do we need?
  > - A model
  > - A causal identification strategy
  > - More granular (bigger) data

---
# What else? (cont.)

There's a lot more to say, but I think we'll stop now for today's lecture.

We also haven't touched on ggplot2's relationship to "tidy" data.
  - It actually forms part of a suite of packages collectively known as the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). 
  - We will get back to this in Lecture 5.

Rest assured, you will be using ggplot2 throughout the rest of this course and developing your skills along the way.
- Your very first assignment (coming up) is a chance specifically to hone some of those skills.

In the meantime, I want you to do some reading and practice on your own. Pick either of the following (or choose among the litany of online resources) and work through their examples:
- [Chapter 3](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) of *R for Data Science* by Hadley Wickham and Garett Grolemund.
- [*Data Visualization: A Practical Guide*](https://socviz.co/makeplot.html) by Kieran Healy.
